/**
 * Swarm Orchestration -- automatic agent transitions via transfer tools.
 *
 * Demonstrates strategy: 'swarm' with LLM-driven, tool-based handoffs.
 * Each agent gets transfer_to_<peer> tools and the LLM decides when to
 * hand off by calling the appropriate transfer tool.
 *
 * Condition-based handoffs (OnTextMention, etc.) remain as optional fallback
 * when no transfer tool is called.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Parent support agent triages the initial request
 *   2. Support agent sees tools: [transfer_to_refund_specialist, transfer_to_tech_support]
 *   3. LLM calls transfer_to_refund_specialist() -> inner loop exits
 *   4. Handoff check detects transfer -> active agent switches
 *   5. Refund specialist handles the request (no transfer) -> loop exits
 *   6. Output: refund specialist's clean response
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - Conductor server with LLM support
 *   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
 *   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
