/**
 * Agent Introductions -- agents introduce themselves before a discussion.
 *
 * Demonstrates the `introduction` parameter on Agent, which adds a
 * self-introduction to the conversation transcript at the start of
 * multi-agent group chats (round_robin, random, swarm, manual).
 *
 * This helps agents understand who they're collaborating with and
 * establishes context for the discussion.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - Conductor server with LLM support
 *   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
 *   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
