/**
 * 39b - Jupyter Kernel Code Execution
 *
 * The JupyterCodeExecutor runs code in a real Jupyter kernel. Variables,
 * imports, and definitions persist between executions -- just like cells in
 * a notebook. Perfect for data-science workflows where analysis is built up
 * step by step.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - Conductor server with LLM support
 *   - Jupyter runtime installed (jupyter_client, ipykernel)
 *   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
 *   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
