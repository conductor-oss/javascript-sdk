/**
 * Agent Discussion -- durable round-robin debate compiled to a Conductor DoWhile loop.
 *
 * Demonstrates a multi-turn discussion between agents with opposing
 * viewpoints using the round_robin strategy. The entire debate runs
 * server-side as a Conductor DoWhile loop -- durable, restartable, and
 * observable in the Conductor UI. After the discussion, a summary agent
 * distills the transcript into a balanced conclusion via the .pipe()
 * pipeline operator.
 *
 * Flow (all server-side):
 *   DoWhile(6 turns):
 *     turn 0 -> optimist
 *     turn 1 -> skeptic
 *     turn 2 -> optimist
 *     ...
 *   summarizer produces conclusion
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - Conductor server with LLM support
 *   - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
 *   - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
