/**
 * Deterministic concurrent-injection contract tests.
 *
 * See docs/design/secret-injection-contract.md §5 — every SDK with framework
 * passthrough has a paired test:
 *   (1) counterfactual that proves the naive pattern races
 *   (2) fix-verification that proves the helper isolates concurrent calls
 *
 * Both use a manual gate (Promise + setter) to force interleaving across
 * `await` boundaries deterministically. No timers, no retries, no flake.
 *
 * Node is single-threaded but `process.env` is shared across all in-flight
 * async operations — two `await`s in different async tasks can interleave
 * around env mutation/restoration just like Python's threading. The same
 * bug class, the same fix shape.
