This document serves to record design decisions to try and share historical context as the project evolves.

###  Using CJS modules instead of ESM modules

who: @nicktomlin

Moving to ESM would mean potentially breaking compatability with folks on modern versions of node who have not switched to ESM and additional overhead in maintaining both systems. Some library authors have decided to simply [convert to ESM wholesale](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/get-ready-for-esm-aa53530b3f77).

I would suggest we maintain CJS compat for now, in the hope that there's either better tooling for "dual publishing" or enough momentum behind ESM that publishing a breaking ESM-only version does not cause too much churn for users.

Because it's relatively simple to support interop between ESM and CJS, and the wide footprint.

### Using `jest` for testing

`jest` can be a little magical, but it's relatively fast (with 28.x especially), ergonomic, and provides a simple maintenance story over a BYO setup.

I considered `mocha` and `ava` (which i've also used and like) but `jest` struck the best balance between simplicity and feature-set at the moment.

### Using `tsup` to publish

who: @nicktomlin

Typescript publication can be a wacky process and `tsup` simplifies a lot of this. 

### Using `undici` to make http2 requests if possible

who: @dmitryborisov-sm

Since Node.js use undici for built-in fetch functionality.
Undici supports H2 and covers all our needs. If undici fails to initialize SDK will fall back to default (HTTP/1.1) fetch in node18 / default (HTTP/2) fetch in browser. It's possible to provide any other custom fetch function while creating SDK so in theory SDK could work on older node version with some libs like node-fetch.

### OpenAPI generated code should not be modified directly

who: @dmitryborisov-sm

SDK should follow layered architecture with all the modifications made in the top layers. This will allow us to easily update autogenerated code and stay in tune with API updates with minimum effort and risk.
